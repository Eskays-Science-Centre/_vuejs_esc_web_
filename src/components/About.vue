        Eskay’s Science Centre is an Entrance (JEE, KEAM, NEET) Based Training Centre, located in 
        Punalur (Municipality), Kollam (District), Kerala (State), established in the year 2021, serving 
        only science students in grades X, XI, and XII (SCERT/CBSE/ICSE).
      </p>
      <p class="mb-4">
        Eskay’s objective is to teach science to our students in the best possible manner by using 
        a variety of instructional strategies with the help of maximum classroom technologies. All 
        students should expect 100% subject mastery and a grade that correlates with that mastery 
        at the end of the course.
      </p>
      <p class="mb-4">
        The general goal for all our classes is for all students to become confident in their own 
        abilities, develop a scientific attitude towards life, and cultivate good habits in life.
      </p>
      <p class="mb-4">
        We provide creative methods of instruction (Differentiated Instructional Strategies) to 
        motivate our students to have scientific attitudes towards their life.
      </p>
      <p class="mb-4">
        We are committed to providing challenging educational experiences that will help our 
        students reach their potential and need energetic and dedicated personnel to help us 
        reach our goals.
